# Level-Gen
A procedural level generator for unity

This level generator is a mix between Enter the Gungeon and The Binding of Isaac. It dynamically creates a main path for a boss to occur at the end of, and is the largest of the paths. It also creates side paths for bonus rooms and for an element of navigation to take place. It was originally made for a game I was developing with a friend.
